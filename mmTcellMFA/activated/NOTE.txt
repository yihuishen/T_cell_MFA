1) "combined": scripts in here used to find best-fit solution (fluxes are loosely constrained between zero and two times the experimentally determined average values, but not fixed)
2) "flux_conf_run": find flux confidence intervals with extracellular exchange flux values fixed. This is suitable to determine flux split ratio
3) "flux_conf_run_exRelax": find flux confidence intervals with extracellular exchange flux values' determined by fitting to data errors (i.e., via non-linear optimization). This is suitable to determine uncertainty of intracellular fluxes propagated from uncertainty in extracellular measurements.
4) "data": 13C-labeling and exchange fluxes data
5) "AMM": carbon mapping model
6) "GEM": metabolic stoichiometry model
